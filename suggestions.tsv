There are 3 types of storages: SSD, 7200RPM HDD and 5400RPM HDD.  SSD: Its much faster, quieter and lighter than both HDD, but its 5-10 times expensive too.  HDD: 7200RPM HDD is 33% faster than 5400RPM HDD. Which means saving/opening a file will be 33% faster !	Try buying SSD storage.
80000	BP	Avoid buying the old lower generation processor laptops, new ones are much better. I5 6th/7th generation and i7 6th/7th generation, both provide enough computational capability for running engineering softwares or rendering a heavy file in photo editor or compiling a lengthy code. i7 will generally perform faster.	i5 6th/7th generation is good. i7 6th/7th generation would be great.	DDR4 type RAM is 20-30% faster than DDR3 type RAM.  8GB will be required for photo editing softwares, running engineering softwares, coding and will also be helpful in multi-tasking. 4GB won't suffice. However, majority options available in the market have only 4GB of RAM. The good part is - RAM can be upgraded later. So in case you are unhappy with 4GB, you can later expand it to 8GB.	Choose atleast 8GB RAM. Buy DDR4 type RAM.	As per your usage you don't need a dedicated graphics card. Dedicated grpahics card is needed for graphics intensive tasks like playing demanding games or professional video editing. Photo editing softwares / Engineering softwares / Coding are more cpu intensive than gpu intensive. A good processor and RAM are important.	Integrated graphics will be enough.

I5 6th/7th generation and i7 6th/7th generation, both provide enough computational capability for running engineering softwares or rendering a heavy file in photo/video editor or compiling a lengthy code or running demanding games smoothly.	i5 6th/7th generation is good. i7 6th/7th generation would be great.	DDR4 type RAM is 20-30% faster than DDR3 type RAM.  Atleast 8GB will be required for gaming, photo/video editing, running engineering softwares and coding. 16GB RAM might be useful in case you plan to edit very large video files in high resolution or play extremely demanding games on high settings (1920x1080). RAM can any ways be upgraded later, so in case you are unhappy with 8GB, you can later expand it to 16GB. 	Choose atleast 8GB RAM. Buy DDR4 type RAM.	You will need upper mid-range or high-range graphics processor (GPU) for high resolution gaming & video editing. Don't buy a laptop with low-end graphic card (like AMD R9 M375, R7 M445/M440/M360/M270, R5 M430/M335/M330 or Nvidia GT 920M/920MX/930M/930MX).	Upper range GPUs (1050, 960M..) would be great, upper mid-range (940MX) will be fine	You will need 2GB of VRAM with mid-range GPUs. Mid-range GPUs are not capable of utilizing more than 2GB of VRAM in most cases. So 4GB of VRAM would only be as good as 2GB. With high-end GPUs (in gaming laptops), 4GB VRAM would be useful.	2GB is enough. 4GB would be great.	There are 3 types of storages: SSD, 7200RPM HDD and 5400RPM HDD.
